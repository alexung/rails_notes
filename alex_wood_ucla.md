====

* people in school are especially focused on research.  not as much into actually creating things? (atleast masters in comp sci)

* jaded by the amount of data science involved in AI

* 2 big benefits though to doing masters:
* 1. resume recognition
* 2. deeper dive into some material

* may be unconscious bias for folks that are interviewing you if you went to a great school.
